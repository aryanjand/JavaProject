# LL-09
Today's LL assignment is just to get you prepared for lecture. You may not have completed all of these things yet, so do as much as you can in the next 5 minutes.
- Take out your UML Diagram and have it ready. Update it if you need to.
- If you haven't already, make classes in Intellij for all of the classes on your UML Diagram and give them the proper extends/implements relationships.
- If you haven't already, create stubs for all your class methods. Run your stubs to make sure everything compiles.
- If you haven't already, write the signatures/javadocs for all of your class methods.

If you've done all this already, congratulations. Choose a new feature to focus on for today's lecture that you have not yet implemented and do the above for it.
